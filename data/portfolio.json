Ever since I got my first computer as a child, I was always curious about it and I just went down the rabbit hole of codingüòõ. \n\nAfter my graduation in 2021, I joined a company called nice.com, which has several products in cloud and feedback management. There my role was pretty diverse and I got to work as a full-stack dev where I built everything from front-end pages to backend and APIs, DevOps pipelines and even wrote automation scripts. üßë‚Äçüíª\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy staying active and healthy through activities such as gym, fitness, boxing, chess, and cycling. I believe that staying fit allows me to bring my best self to my work as a developer and in all aspects of my life.üèãÔ∏è\n\n",
